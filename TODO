gameplay
========
- Make it possible for the field clearing punishment to occur


graphics
========
- Nonobtrusive background for playing field
- Better line disappearing effect
- Intro screen


sound
=====
- Sound effects for landing, rotating, deleting, etc.
- Really tedious music.


misc
====
- Incorporate ports into Makefile somehow


ideas
=====
- randomized blocks
- push field up when a line near the bottom is > 50% empty
- drop new blocks when we want to, not when one lands
- transpose columns
- open up space in the middle of the field by shifting column off the edge
