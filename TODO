gameplay
========
- be able to hold down sideways movement keys
- better game over detection and handling
- try to clear out full lines before end of game


graphics
========
- Enable HW acceleration?
- Make a better layout for the main playing screen complete with borders
  and things like that.
- The blocks are really ugly.  They need to be pictures of random shapes.
  We're not going to be constrained to tetris block shapes, either.  The
  current blocks are just temporary to test everything else out.
- Some sort of welcome/credits/whatever intro screen.
- Better line disappearing effect.


sound
=====
- Sound effects for landing, rotating, deleting, etc.
- Really tedious music.


misc
====
- port to Windows
- port to MacOS X
