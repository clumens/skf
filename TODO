gameplay
========
- Blocks currently always drop from the middle, but should pick a random
  starting X coordinate.
- Full lines currently always disappear.  Instead, we should apply a
  probability distribtion to the full lines so that they disappear
  eventually but not necessarily as soon as they are filled.
- Some sort of punishment for clearing out the board after the initial
  block has been dropped.
- Visible timer counting up from when the game was started, to let you
  know how long you've been playing.
- Properly detect end of game.
- Blocks should fall at random speeds.
- Ability to very briefly move the block sideways once it's landed?
- Rotate blocks.


graphics
========
- Need to enable HW acceleration if at all possible  (I know basically how
  to do this, but xinerama doesn't get along with hardware acceleration so
  I don't really have a way to test it out right now.)
- Make a better layout for the main playing screen complete with borders
  and things like that.
- The blocks are really ugly.  They need to be pictures of random shapes.
  We're not going to be constrained to tetris block shapes, either.  The
  current blocks are just temporary to test everything else out.
- Some sort of welcome/credits/whatever intro screen.
- Better line disappearing effect.


sound
=====
- Sound effects for landing, rotating, deleting, etc.
- Really tedious music.
